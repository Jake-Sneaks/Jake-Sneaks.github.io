## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

Lab 3, part 1
In this lab we had to compare individual unit prices to calculate the best price on pizza. This lab was one my favorites solely off of its conversion of language. Itâ€™s fascinating in my mind to see how written mathematics converts to code. This thought was a good beginning to understanding how to use function definitions.

Lab 6
Overall lab six was enjoyable, both in teaching arguments with sandwich combos and with using bools for blackjack. While writing the bool definitions in entirety at first was difficult, it made it feel rewarding to accomplish them. 

Lab 12
In its entirety, it was my favorite lab due to its use of both (Pseudo) Random Number Generation and the RGB color spectrum. It creates a beautiful perspective of the creation that comes with coding, and allows me to understand ratios and their usefulness.
